Project: Landing Page by The Odin Project

I will create a landing page by using a image of the finished page as a guideline. Another image will have colors, fonts etc. that they use.

I can add my own content to the page if I want. This project is part of the Foundations curriculum and will test my skills with HTML and CSS and what I have learned so far.
